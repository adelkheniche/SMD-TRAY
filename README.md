You'll need
-6mm Acrylic (PMMA)
-A laser cutter
-3D printer.
In this Repo you'll find the
SVG file for laser cutting the plate.
STL file of the small boxes, who need to be press fit.
and you'll find the Fusion 360, (be careful it's pretty messy in there.)

Start by 3D print every stl file before cutting the plate.
you'll be able to adjust the svg file. every 3D printer doesn't have the same specs.
